            <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">Sanctions Watch was built on the conviction that access to timely, accurate conflict intelligence should not be limited to governments, think tanks, or expensive subscription services. We believe that journalists, researchers, policy analysts, students, and engaged citizens deserve access to quality information to understand the world's most pressing security challenges.</p>
            <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">In a world where armed conflicts shape economies, displace populations, and determine the course of history, we are committed to making conflict data accessible, transparent, and useful.</p>

            <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">Sanctions Watch provides a comprehensive database of international sanctions, arms embargoes, and economic restrictions related to armed conflicts. Our platform aggregates, verifies, and presents this data in a format designed for clarity, so users can quickly understand the current situation and track changes over time.</p>
            <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">We cover active conflicts across multiple regions, providing visualizations, timelines, and analysis that contextualizes data within broader geopolitical realities.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-4">Our Data Sources &amp; Methodology</h2>
            <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">Our data is compiled from publicly available sources: official government reports, United Nations agencies (OCHA, UNHCR, WFP), academic conflict databases (ACLED, SIPRI, Uppsala Conflict Data Program), verified open-source intelligence, and internationally recognized news organizations.</p>
            <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">We prioritize source transparency and cross-reference multiple sources. Where sources disagree, we present the range of estimates rather than a single contested figure.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-4">Why This Matters</h2>
            <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">Conflict data is inherently sensitive and contested. We strive to present information in a factual, non-partisan manner — to ensure accurate information supports informed discussion, humanitarian response, and evidence-based policy. The data we track represents real human lives, and that responsibility guides everything we do.</p>

            <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">The platform was developed by a team of data engineers, journalists, and security researchers passionate about making conflict intelligence accessible to the public. Our backgrounds span open-source intelligence (OSINT), data visualization, and international security studies.</p>
            <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">We are not affiliated with any government, military organization, or political group. Funded entirely through advertising revenue, allowing us to remain independent and freely accessible to all users worldwide.</p>

            <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">Traditional news media covers conflicts reactively. Sanctions Watch provides continuous, structured monitoring that persists beyond news cycles. Where newspapers provide narrative, we provide data.</p>
            <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">Our structured data format makes it easy for researchers to track trends, compare across regions, and identify patterns invisible in unstructured reporting.</p>
